Rexster is a graph server that exposes any "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph through HTTP/REST and a binary protocol called "RexPro":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/RexPro. "Extensions":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/Extensions support standard traversal goals such as search, score, rank, and, in concert, recommendation. Rexster makes extensive use of "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com, "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com, and "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com. In this way its possible to run Rexster over various graph systems including:

 * "TinkerGraph":http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph in-memory graph
 * "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/ graph database
 * "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/ graph database
 * "Sparksee":http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/#sparksee graph database
 * "Titan":http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/ graph database
 * "Sesame 2.0":http://www.openrdf.org compliant RDF stores
 * Many "third-party":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki Blueprints implementations

Rexster provides a browser-based user interface known as "The Dog House":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/The-Dog-House. This interface allows for viewing vertices, edges, and their related properties. A web-based console for executing "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com scripts is provided along with a "Rexster Console":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/Rexster-Console which allows remote evaluation of scripts within the Rexster Server context.
